## v3.0 UPDATE: Dual-Mode Datasets (Feb 10, 2026)

### Background
Initial v3.0 achieved **98.51% F1 score**, which raised concerns about being "too good to be true." 
Data analysis revealed **91.5% of attacks** were easily detectable using a simple rule: `connection_count > 13`.

### Solution: Dual-Mode Datasets
Created **two difficulty modes** to balance learning demonstration vs real-world accuracy:

#### **Simple Mode** (Original)
- **Purpose:** Learning, proof of concept, demonstration
- **Characteristics:**
  - Normal connection_count: 1-19
  - Attack connection_count: mostly 50-500
  - 91.5% detectable by trivial threshold rule
- **Results:** F1=0.9851, AUC=0.9991, FPR=1.0%
- **All attacks:** ≥96.6% detection rate (brute force 100%)

#### **Realistic Mode** (New)
- **Purpose:** Production testing, real-world evaluation
- **Characteristics:**
  - Normal connection_count: 1-119 (added bulk operations, server tasks)
  - Attack connection_count: 1-499 (50% brute force now stealthy 8-50 range)
  - Only 68.4% easily detectable
  - 72.2% of attacks overlap with normal ranges
- **Results:** F1=0.9131, AUC=0.9805, FPR=2.33%
- **Challenging attacks:** Brute force 49.6%, Stealth probe 76.4%

### File Structure Changes
```
data/
├── simple/          # Original dataset
└── realistic/       # New challenging dataset

ml/results/
├── simple/          # Simple mode training results
│   ├── model.pkl, ensemble_lof.pkl, scaler.pkl
│   ├── training_metrics.json, TRAINING_REPORT.md
│   └── plots/ (9 visualizations)
└── realistic/       # Realistic mode training results
    ├── model.pkl, ensemble_lof.pkl, scaler.pkl
    ├── training_metrics.json, TRAINING_REPORT.md
    └── plots/ (9 visualizations)

COMPARISON.md        # Comprehensive side-by-side analysis
```

### Key Improvements
- **Honest ML evaluation**: Both modes documented with transparent accuracy explanations
- **Flexible usage**: Choose mode based on use case (learning vs production)
- **Data generation script**: `python ml/generate_data.py [simple|realistic]`
- **Training script**: `python ml/train_model.py [simple|realistic]`
- **Comparison tool**: `python ml/compare_datasets.py` for analysis

### Verdict
- ✓ **Simple mode accuracy (98.5%) is legitimate** - pipeline works correctly
- ✓ **BUT data is too clean** - explains unrealistic performance
- ✓ **Realistic mode (91.3%) is production-ready** - genuinely challenging
- ✓ **Both modes have value** - learning vs real-world testing
